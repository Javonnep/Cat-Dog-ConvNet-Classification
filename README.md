After creating this notebook, I tested it with some stuff from duckduckgo (any browser is fine) andit was correct in all 3 cases. I could have added more images but I was able to see in the validation accuracy that the model was fine. I also could have added a function to validate the prediction(since I put the final images in their own categorised folder) but that didnt seem necessary because as a human I can tell the difference between Cats and Dogs pretty accurately.

Overall Im happy with this notebook since I've wanted to learn about Neural Networks for quite a while. It turned out well, originally I planned to use a GUI but the interface of Jupyter is very nice on its own so that didnt seem necessary.
