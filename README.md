# SummerProject
Conv net focussed project

The end goal is a project made in python with a GUI. You populate two ConvNets with two datasets and you also have an external image.

It will show you the probability that the external image is a member of each dataset. It will then predict which dataset the external image belongs to and will naturally have a certain amount of certainty that it will give as a measure of confidence
