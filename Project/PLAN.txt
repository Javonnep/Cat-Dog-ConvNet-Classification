IMPLEMENT CONVNET ON A DATASET(Get probability measure):

TEST IMAGE RECOGNITION WITH IMAGE FROM OUTSIDE OF DATASET:

IMPLEMENT TWO CONVNETS IN ONE PROGRAM:

TEST IMAGE RECOGNITION WITH IMAGE FROM OUTSIDE OF DATASET (WITH BOTH CONVNETS):

LEARN HOW TO MAKE PYGAME GUI'S:

LEARN HOW TO IMPLEMENT CONVNET WITH GUI: 

		END GOAL:
The end goal is a project made in python with a GUI. You populate two ConvNets with two datasets and you 
also have an external image.

It will show you the probability that the external image is a member of each dataset. It will then predict 
which dataset the external image belongs to and will naturally have a certain amount of certainty 
(the aformentioned probability) that it'll give as a measure of confidence
